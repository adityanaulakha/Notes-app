# Notes App

**Notes App** is a simple React application built with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and custom UI components from [uiverse.io](https://www.uiverse.io/). The app allows users to add, view, and manage notes. The data is persisted in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring notes remain available even after page reloads.

## üìñ Background

The goal of this project is to create a simple note-taking service that allows users to add and view notes. The application uses `localStorage` to store the notes client-side, eliminating the need for a backend. The focus is on UI clarity, state management, and user experience.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a note-taking UI in **React** using **Vite**.
- Persist notes client-side using **localStorage**.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for UI styling and incorporate components from **uiverse.io** for buttons and input fields.
- Document design decisions related to component structure, state management, and styling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

### Project Setup

- **Vite Setup:** The project was bootstrapped using `npm create vite@latest` to quickly set up a modern React environment.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling to enable fast, utility-based styling and responsive design.
- **UI Components:** Buttons and input fields are sourced from [uiverse.io](https://www.uiverse.io/) for aesthetic and functional UI components.

### Storage Strategy

A custom utility in `storage.js` manages the reading and writing of notes to `localStorage`.

- **Why localStorage + key naming:** 
  - `localStorage` is used to ensure that notes are saved on the user's device even after page reloads or browser restarts.
  - The key `custom_notes` is used for clarity, making it easy to identify and access stored notes.

### Add Note Component

- **AddNote.jsx:**
  - Contains controlled input fields for the note's title and content.
  - On form submission, the input data is passed to the `storage.js` utility to update `localStorage`, and the displayed list of notes is updated.

- **Why useState + submit handler:**
  - `useState` is used for managing the state of the input fields (title and content).
  - The submit handler is responsible for saving the note to `localStorage` and triggering a UI update.

### Notes List Component

- **NotesList.jsx:**
  - Loads saved notes from `localStorage` when the component is mounted using `useEffect`.
  - Displays each note's title and a snippet of its content.
  
- **Why useEffect to sync storage ‚Üí state:**
  - `useEffect` ensures the notes are loaded from `localStorage` as soon as the component mounts, updating the UI with the most recent data.

### Navigation

Minimal navigation is provided using buttons that toggle between the "Add Note" and "View Notes" pages.

- **Why this nav approach for simplicity:**
  - The simple button navigation provides a clear, intuitive way to toggle between the different views of the app (adding and viewing notes).

### Styling & UX

- **Styling Approach:**
  - **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling due to its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid styling with minimal effort.
  - Components like buttons and input fields are taken from **uiverse.io**, which provides beautifully designed, responsive elements.
  - The UI is designed to be simple, clean, and intuitive to use.

- **Loading & Error States:**
  - If the app encounters an issue with reading or writing to `localStorage`, an error message is displayed to inform the user.
  
  - **Why show spinner here:**
    - A "Saving..." spinner is shown when the note is being saved, offering feedback that the operation is in progress.

  - **Why display error banner:**
    - To alert the user if there‚Äôs an issue with saving or reading notes, ensuring they are aware of any failure.

## üì¶ Deliverables

- Full source code is available under the project folder.
- `.gitignore` is included to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- The README.md includes setup instructions and rationale for key design decisions.

## üöÄ Setup & Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-URL>

2. Navigate to the project directory: 

     ```bash
    cd <project-folder>

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

5. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

### üìù "Why?" Documentation

- **Storage Strategy:** `localStorage` was chosen because it allows persistent storage of the notes on the client-side, even after page reloads. Using the key `custom_notes` ensures clarity and easy management of the notes stored.

- **Component Design:** The app is broken into small, focused components:
  - **AddNote:** Handles the input of new notes.
  - **NotesList:** Displays the stored notes and allows for their management.

- **State Management:**
  - **useState** is used to manage the input fields for the note's title and content.
  - **useEffect** is employed to load notes from `localStorage` when the `NotesList` component is mounted.

- **Styling:** 
  - **Tailwind CSS** was chosen for rapid styling due to its utility-first classes, which make it quick to create responsive layouts and stylish elements.
  - Components from **uiverse.io** were used to ensure a polished and user-friendly interface.

- **Navigation:** Simple button navigation was implemented to toggle between "Add Note" and "View Notes" pages. This was done to provide a straightforward and intuitive user experience.
